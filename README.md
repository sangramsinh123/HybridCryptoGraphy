# HybridCryptoGraphy

Combination of Symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption. Here, Public key encryption is used to exchange data. Whereas, symmetric encryption is used to encrypt communication. Hybrid encryption is used in all forms of internet communication between client and server these days. SSL handshake is one good example of Hybrid encryption.
Hybrid encryption is a mode of encryption that merges two or more encryption systems. It incorporates a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to benefit from the strengths of each form of encryption. These strengths are respectively defined as speed and security. RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric-key block cipher. This is a java Application simulating Hybrid cryptography using the above algorithms.
